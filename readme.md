## 👨‍💻 About Me

My goal is to create useful, practical applications for the daily life. I imagine data science must be accessable for everybody to support their everyday tasks and decisions.

- 📐 I work as a BI consultant at Deutsche Telekom. My favourite thing is finding ways to use data science applications in BI.
- 📌 I have got my PhD degree from applied algebraic logic. My theseses were on the generalized database theories.
